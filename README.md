# Project: Risk Tabletop Game Implementation for Desktop Machines

## Description

> Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players.
> The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of Earth, divided into forty-two territories,
> which are grouped into six continents. Turn rotates among players who control armies of playing pieces with which
> they attempt to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls. Players may form
> and dissolve alliances during the course of the game. The goal of the game is to occupy every territory on the
> board and in doing so, eliminate the other players. The game can be lengthy, requiring several hours to multiple
> days to finish. (Cut & Pasted from "wikipedia.com")

## Features to be Implemented (Rough)
The entirety of the board game will be implemented. Beyond that, the primary objectives of this project is adding **_multiplayer_**, 
AI(?) opponents and new maps to the game. Depending on time left after these. More content *will* be added. 

Shortly said, this will be an extended version of the traditional Risk game, designed so that it can be played alone or with people from far away locations (unlike the original version, which requires a certain number of people to be strictly around the game board), and will have more gameplay content than the original Risk, such as new maps, and depending on time left after the key features are implemented, even more.
