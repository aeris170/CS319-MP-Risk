# Project: Risk Tabletop Game Implementation for Desktop Machines

## Description

Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players.
The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of Earth, divided into forty-two territories,
which are grouped into six continents. Turn rotates among players who control armies of playing pieces with which
they attempt to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls. Players may form
and dissolve alliances during the course of the game. The goal of the game is to occupy every territory on the
board and in doing so, eliminate the other players. The game can be lengthy, requiring several hours to multiple
days to finish. (Cut&Pasted from "wikipedia.com")
