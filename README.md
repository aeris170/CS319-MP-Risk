# Project: Risk Tabletop Game Implementation for Desktop Machines

## Description

> Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players.
> The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of Earth, divided into forty-two territories,
> which are grouped into six continents. Turn rotates among players who control armies of playing pieces with which
> they attempt to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls. Players may form
> and dissolve alliances during the course of the game. The goal of the game is to occupy every territory on the
> board and in doing so, eliminate the other players. The game can be lengthy, requiring several hours to multiple
> days to finish. (Cut & Pasted from "wikipedia.com")

## What we will do:
As Private Moon Nobleman, we will implement the entirety of the board game, cards are out due to balancing. Beyond that, the primary objectives of this project are adding **_online multiplayer_**, AI opponents and new maps and maybe even a map making tool.

Shortly said, this will be an extended version of the traditional Risk game, designed so that it can be played alone or with people from far away locations (unlike the original version, which requires a certain number of people to be strictly around the game board), and will have more gameplay content than the original Risk.

## Screenshots of the implementation so far:
* **To be added asap**.
